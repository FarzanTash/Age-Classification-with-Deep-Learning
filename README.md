# Age Classification with Deep Learning

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to predict age categories from facial images using a multi-class classification approach. The primary goal is to accurately classify images of faces into predefined age groups.

## Dataset

### Nature of the Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of facial images categorized by age. Each image is labeled with the corresponding age group, enabling the model to learn and differentiate between various age categories.

### Details of the Dataset

The dataset is structured into directories, each representing a different age group. The images within these directories are used for training and testing the model. The dataset includes a diverse range of facial images, ensuring that the model can generalize well across different demographics.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - Loaded the dataset and organized it into age categories.
   - Performed data augmentation to increase the diversity of the training data and prevent overfitting.
   
2. **Model Development**:
   - Utilized a pre-trained ResNet50 model from TensorFlow Keras applications as the base model.
   - Added custom layers on top of the pre-trained model to adapt it for the age classification task.
   
3. **Training**:
   - Trained the model on the preprocessed dataset, fine-tuning the pre-trained model to improve its performance on the age classification task.
   
4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated the model's performance using confusion matrices and accuracy metrics.
   - Visualized the results to understand the model's strengths and weaknesses in classifying different age groups.

5. **Visualization**:
   - Created visualizations such as bar charts to represent the distribution of age groups in the dataset.
   - Plotted confusion matrices to analyze the model's performance across different age categories.
